# Newsfeed App

This project is a simple refresher **Newsfeed Application** built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **SCSS**. The goal is to improve front-end system design and implementation skills by creating a real-world application from scratch. This project follows best practices for modularity, component reuse, and state management, while incorporating type safety with TypeScript and responsive design with SCSS.

## Purpose

- To gain a deeper understanding of **end-to-end application development**.
- To strengthen practical knowledge of React components, hooks, and state management.
- To implement a structured, scalable codebase with **TypeScript** for type safety.
- To enhance my styling skills using **SCSS** for modular and maintainable styles.

## Key Learnings

- Structuring a front-end project for scalability with reusable components, proper state management, and modular CSS.
- Using **TypeScript** to improve code quality with well-defined types, ensuring code is predictable and maintainable.
- Developing a user interface with React, handling dynamic content such as creating posts, and simulating real-world functionalities.
- Building an efficient workflow, including setting up **Git**, writing **clean and organized code**, and learning **system design principles** that are applicable in front-end interviews.
